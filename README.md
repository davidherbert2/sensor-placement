This is a demonstrator of the current state of the NU Urban Observatory, done as an interactive OpenLayers map.  Several other layers from Newcastle City Council and The UK Office of National Statistics are also overlaid.  These are served from an [Amazon AWS  instance](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Instances:sort=keyName) named ndh114_gis_server.
